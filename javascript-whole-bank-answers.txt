Question 1
You are creating a web page that tests a userâ€™s ability to accurately type text. The validation should be case-insensitive.
How should you complete the code? To answer, drag appropriate functions to the correct locations. Each function may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

Answer= 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      function validate() {
        var input = document.getElementById("tester2").value;
        var text = document.getElementById("userText").innerHTML;
        if (input.toLowerCase() == text.toLowerCase()) {
          alert("Success");
        }
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="userText">When in the course of human events...</p>
    <input type="input" id="tester2">
    <button onclick="validate()">Validate</button>
  </body>
</html>


Question 2
You are using JavaScript to create a calculator.

You create the following HTML. Line numbers are included for reference only.

 

     <form id = "calculator">
      <input type = "text" id = "a"/>
      <input type = "text" id = "b"/>
      <input type = "text" id = "result"/>
      <input type = "button" onclick = "add()" value = "+"/>
     </form>
 

You must create a function named add() that adds the values in the a and b input elements and displays the result in the result input element. You define the following function in JavaScript:

function add() {

}
 
You need to complete the body of the function.
Which three code segments should you use to develop the solution?

Answer=
function add() {
    var a = eval(document.getElementById("a").value);
    var b = eval(document.getElementById("b").value);
    document.getElementById("result").value = a + b;
}


Question 3
You need to evaluate the following code segment.

01     var n;
02     console.log(typeof n);
03     var a = "3.4";
04     console.log(typeof a);
05     var textArray = ["Welcome back", "Incorrect answer", "Enter a name"];
06     console.log(typeof textArray);
07     var c = 2.4;
08     console.log(typeof c);
09     var tag = null;
10     console.log(typeof tag);

Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that answers each question based on the information presented
in the code segment.

What does the console.log function on line 02 write to the console?     
Answer = undefined
What does the console.log function on line 04 write to the console?     
Answer = string
What does the console.log function on line 06 write to the console?     
Answer = object
What does the console.log function on line 08 write to the console?     
Answer = number
What does the console.log function on line 10 write to the console?     
Answer = object


Question 4
You are writing a function that calculates the remainder for integer division.
The function receives two parameters, a and b, and must return the remainder that is left over when the integer a is divided by the integer b.
You create the following code. Line numbers are for reference only

01     function remainder(a, b) {
02     
03    
04     }

You want to complete the function for lines 02 and 03.
Which two sets of code segments should you use? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. (Choose two.) 

Answer=
a = a % b;
return a

a % b;
return a
